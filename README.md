# rc-whitespace
'RC Whitespace' Joomla Template.

You're probably not going to want to use this. I'm using GitHub for convenience here, rather than with the intention of sharing this widely. The template contains a lot of styling that's specific to my site, and is probably missing styling used by most other Joomls sites.
